# ZUOnlineRegistrationSystem

# Project description
The ZU E-Registration system is a service that enables a student to enroll in courses in a convenient way.
Since there have been some dissatisfactions with the current system, we are triggered to develop a new
system which aims at updating the existing system. 

The main objectives of the proposed web-based system are listed below. 
    ✓ Saves students’ and admins’ time
    ✓ Generates the possible alternative schedules
    ✓ Requests add/drop course(s) via the system in an easy way.
    ✓ Automates the registration process without an advisor
    ✓ Creates university classes for the admin.
    ✓ Makes the E-Registration easy to use.
